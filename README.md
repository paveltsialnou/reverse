# Utility reverse

#### Requirements

 - The Haskell Tool Stack tool should be installed (_read how to [install][1]_).

#### Build instructions

To build run following:

```sh
$ stack build
```

_Read more about [stack][2] usage._

#### Installation

Run next command to install `reverse`:

```sh
$ stack install
```

_`reverse` would be placed in `~/.local/bin` directory. Ensure that it is in your `$PATH`._

#### Usage

```sh
$ reverse Setup.hs
elpmiS.noitubirtsiD tropmi
)( OI :: niam
niaMtluafed = niam
$ reverse Setup.hs | reverse
import Distribution.Simple
main :: IO ()
main = defaultMain
```

#### What's in plans

 - Document it
